Tests

In order to keep us nimble and allow us to bring you new functionality, without compromising on stability, we have ensured full test coverage of the new SDK. We are including this in the open source repository to assure you of our commitment to quality, but also with the hopes that you will contribute back to help keep it stable. The easiest way to do so is to file bugs and include a test case.
